## Overview 

TrueDEX aims to create a global exchange network with an open interface for faster, non-custodial and confidential trading of digital assets.

To do that, we take advantage of the UTXO model and then the underlying capability of Elements-based networks to perform automated **swaps**, without the need of a trusted third-party. We propose to consolidate the stakeholders on an open standard for swaps, described in the [BOTD #3: Swap Protocol](03-swap-protocol.md)
